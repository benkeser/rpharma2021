## COVID-19 Prevention Network

[CoVPN](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/) was [formed by NIAID](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-clinical-trials-network-test-covid-19-vaccines-other-prevention-tools) to establish a unified clinical trial network for evaluating vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.

* pooling of resources across __four existing trials networks__
* clinical sites, laboratories, recruitment specialists, statisticians, ...

## Correlates of risk/protection

Two, interrelated goals of correlates analysis are to 

* identify/validate possible __surrogate endpoints__;
* understand __protective mechanisms__ of vaccines. 

If an __immune correlate__ is established to __reliably predict vaccine efficacy__, then subsequent efficacy trials may use the CoP as the __primary endpoint__. 

__Accelerates approval__ of

* existing vaccines in __different populations__ (e.g., children);
* __new vaccines__ in the same class.

## Correlates considerations

From the outset, we knew that this science would be:

* __heavily scrutinized__

  * need for transparent, open science.

* __high impact__

  * need to "get it right"

* __reproduced for many trials__

  * five USG-funded trials + others

---

## Correlates challenges

From the outset, we recognized there would be challenges:

* .red[complex statistical methodology]

  * different analysts need to implement different analyses

* .red[difficult-to-reproduce methodology]

  * ensemble machine learning with cross-validation

* .red[regulatory compliant computing framework]

  * FDA interested in results

* .red[under extreme time pressure]

  * information needed ASAP to inform policy

---

## Correlates challenges

For Moderna, we also faced the key challenge that we had

## Open science

Early on, we posted a version-controlled SAP [online](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/CoVPN_COVID-19_Vaccine_Efficacy_Trial_Immune_Correlates_SAP/13198595).

.center[

```{r, sap, echo = FALSE, out.height = "150px", out.width = "400px"}

Open software development on GitHub.
* [CoVPN/correlates_reporting](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting_usgcove_archive)
* 3,042 commits and counting... üòé

<br>

‚úÖ need for transparent, open science

## Project organization

Loose guidelines for __sub-directory structure__.

* consistency vs. expediency

Each sub-directory produces a __child R Markdown report__.

* `Makefile` used to document dependencies

Master `Makefile` and `bookdown` run analyses and __produce final reports__.

<br> 

‚úÖ different analysts need to implement different analyses

‚úÖ under extreme time pressure

---

## Code verification

.red[High importance results] underwent double programming.

* original programmer = generate specification document
* independent programmer = generate same results
* confirm identical results

[Ellis Hughes](https://twitter.com/ellis_hughes) was instrumental in this effort.

Double programming included __ensemble machine learning__ results!

‚úÖ need to "get it right"

‚úÖ difficult-to-reproduce methodology

---

## Remote computing

Approaches used to prepare for Moderna analysis:

* "Practice" data set for local development

  * Detailed specifications given to Moderna stats to align data formatting, definitions, etc...

* `R` package control using [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html)

  * üíØ

* Continuous integration using [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)
  
  * configure environment to be "Moderna"-like
  * automated report builds on practice data, pushed back to GitHub

## Happy endings

After many hours, and with great patience from Weiping Deng, we were able to get the report to compile.

* 1129 pages in total üò¶

A preprint is available on [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.09.21261290v1)

* doi: 10.1101/2021.08.09.21261290v1
* Currently under revision at *Science*

## Looking forward

‚ùì‚ùì reproduced for many trials ‚ùì‚ùì

Code is being __generalized__ to adapt to additional trials

* A more [general correlates reporting](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting2) process
* __Custom configurations__ depending on trial specifications

Analyses in the pipeline:

* HVTN 705 (HIV vaccine)
* Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) COVID
* AstraZeneca, SinoVac, CureVac, NovaVax, Sanofi-Pasteur

---

## Lessons learned

* Standardizing computing architectures is __relatively straightforward__. .red[Standardizing data formatting/processing is not].

* .red[Code defensively]: check for missing values, sanity check inputs, ...

* .red[Continuous integration] is your (best) friend as a code supervisor.

* Always a difficult tension between .red[speed vs. quality coding].
